This Tic-Tac-Toe project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive 3x3 grid where two players alternately place X and O. JavaScript handles game logic, including turn switching, win condition checks, draw detection, and board resetting. CSS enhances the visual layout with a clean and responsive design. The game alerts players when someone wins or if it’s a draw, ensuring a smooth and fun user experience. It’s a great beginner project to practice DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
